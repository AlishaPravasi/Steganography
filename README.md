# Steganography is a close cousin of cryptography. Rather than changing the contents of a message by encrypting it, the unmodified information is disguised or hidden in some way.
In the digital age, steganography takes a variety of novel and creative forms. In this project I steganographically hide a photographic image within another photograph, and also 
extract images others have similarly hidden within other images.
